- File xfer

- ICQ testing and debugging (don't even bother trying it yet)

- Improve error messages -- check for subcodes, etc.

- Offline message support (code is there, but isn't fully tested yet)

- Secure connection support

- If requesting a new service and our main connection is SSL, add empty TLV 0x8C to the service request.
  Similarly, if the requested service redirect response (0x05) contains TLV 0x8E, use SSL if val > 0, else no SSL

- Handle server-initiated BOS migrations

- Queue any requests for paused services and replay them after migration is complete or a resume response is sent by the server

- Use setTimeout to send a keepalive packet on FLAP channel 0x05 -- time == 1 min? Digsby & Pidgin use a 30 sec timeout)
  Note: Pidgin only seems to send keepalive on the main connection, unlike Digsby which sends keepalive on every connection
  Also: the timer should be (re)started after each write to the socket and thus should not be sent if the connection isn't idle

- Actually reply every x hours (given by the server-initiated USAGE_STATS SNAC) with service 0x0B subtype 0x03

- Pay attention to rate warnings and limits -- automatically do this at the _send() level and queue up commands before we hit
  the limit and SNACs start dropping?

- Set up an interval to periodically clean out any answered requests or requests that have gone unanswered for some
  fixed length of time (will require tagging each request with a (unix) timestamp). Although, calling delete can send
  V8 into a slow case, maybe we should instead just set anything not already undefined to undefined?

- Automatically use a secure connection (to slogin.oscar.aol.com for AOL or slogin.icq.com for ICQ) if options.connection.host
  is one of the defaults (login.oscar.aol.com for AOL or login.icq.com for ICQ).
  Port 5190 or 443 can be used for secure connections. Also, there is an alternate non-secure address for AOL: login.messaging.aol.com
